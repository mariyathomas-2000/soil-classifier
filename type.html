        <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
        <p>There are different types of soil. They are as follows:<br>
            
            1.Sandy Soil<br>
            2.Clayey Soil<br>
            3.Loamy Soil<br>
            4.Black Soil<br>
            5.Red Soil<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Soil Classification on the Based on Particles Size</h2>
        <h4>1. Sandy soil</h4>
        <p>Sandy soil contains more than 60% sand and clay. It contains very little clay and silt, so it is porous.<br>
            The size of soil particles in sandy soil is from 0.2mm to 2.0mm. The water building capacity of a sandy<br>
            soil is very poor. Hence, there is a lot of air present in this type of soil.

types of soil - sandy soil</p>
        <img src="image/sandy.png" alt="sandy">
        <p>Suitable Crops:<br>
            Sandy soil is not good for plants. However,<u> melon and coconut</u> grow in sandy soil. If water is available for irrigation then<br>
            crops such as<u> maize, millets, barley</u> can be grown in desert soil. <u>Cactus</u> also grows in this soil.</p>
        <h4>2. Clayey Soil</h4>
        <p>The clayey soil consists of very fine particles of clay. Its water holding capacity is very high.<br>
            Wet clay soil is very sticky. It contains very little air. The size of soil particles in clay size is less than 0.2mm. <br>
            Clayey soil is rich in organic matter.</p>
        <img src="image/clay.png" alt="clay">
        <p>Suitable Crops:<br>
            It is also not good for many plants. It is only good for crops like <u>paddy</u>,<br>
            which require a lot of water. Clay is used for making toys, pots, and many other purposes.</p>
        <h4>3. Loamy Soil</h4>
        <p>The loamy soil consists of sand, clay,, and silt. It also contains enough hummus. It has a good water-holding capacity.<br>
      
            It has sufficient aeration. It is well suited for cultivation. Roots of plants get enough water, air, and space to grow.
        </p>
        <img src="image/loamy.png" alt="loamy">
        <p>Suitable Crops:<br>
            Loamy soil is ideal for growing crops such as<u> wheat, sugarcane, cotton, jute, pulses, and oilseeds</u>.<br>
            <u> Vegetables also grow well in this soil.</u></p>
        <h2>Soil Classification on the Based on Color</h2>
        <h4>1. Red soil</h4>
        <p>The red color of soil is due to the presence of iron oxide. It appears yellow when it contains less iron or more water.<br>
            Red soil contains a mixture of clay and sand, antis not fertile. However, the soil can be fertile by adding manures and <br>
            fertilizers.</p>
        <img src="image/red.png" alt="red">
        <p>Suitable Crops: <br>
            It is suitable for growing <u>groundnuts, pulses, millet, cotton and tobacco</u>.</p>
        <h4>2. Black soil</h4>
        <p>Black soil is also known as black lava soil. This soil black in color.<br>
            It is formed from lava rocks and is rich in clay.</p>
        <img src="image/black.png" alt="black">
        <p>Suitable Crops: <br>
            It is ideal for growing crops such as <u>cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, wheat, millets, and oilseeds.</u></p>
