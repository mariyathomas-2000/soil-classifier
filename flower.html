        <h2>Nutrients in Flowering Plants</h2>
        <img src="image/flower.png" alt="flower">
        <p>Three prime chemical elements are found in all mixed fertilizers:<br>
            
            N = Nitrogen promotes healthy leaf growth by stimulating the production of chlorophyll (the main chemical involved in photosynthesis—how plants convert sunlight to food).<br>
            
            P = Phosphorus supports the vigorous development of roots, stems, blossoms, and fruits.<br>
            
K = Potassium plays a key role in helping plants digest and manufacture their foods.</p>
        <h3>What plants need</h3>
        <p>The three essential elements that all plants need are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—or N-P-K, the proportions of which are <br>
            stated as numbers on the package. For instance, a general-purpose fertilizer labeled 20-20-20 means that each chemical element—N, P, and K—contributes 20 percent <br>
            by weight to the total formula (the remaining 40 percent is composed of inert materials and trace elements).<br>
            The element percentages are offered in varying proportions to suit different fertil­izer needs.<br>
            If you are looking to boost flower production, you want a mix like 15-30-15, which is high in flower-developing phosphorus. <br>
            If you want to green up your lawn, choose a mix like 25-6-4, which is high in nitrogen.<br>
            Many fertilizers are formulated for specific plants like roses, bulbs, or vegetables. <br>
            Be sure to check the label for the N-P-K ratio, as you may be able to use a general fertilizer with close to the same nutrient percentages but at a lower price.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Choose</h2>
        <p>There are two types of fertilizers available to the home gardener: granular and water soluble.<br>
            Each type has advantages and disadvantages. Granular fertilizers deliver food to a plant slowly but have the advantage of longevity.<br>
            Since they must be broken down by water before a plant can use them, granular fertilizers do not leach out of the soil as rapidly as water-soluble types. <br>
            Water-soluble fertilizers are faster acting but more transient, which means they must be applied more frequently than the granular type.<br>
            

Both types of fertilizers are effective, so the one you choose depends on whether you want to give your plants a quick but frequent fix or a sluggish but extended feeding. <br>
And for those of us gardeners who are oh so very busy (or oh so very lazy), nothing beats time-release granular fertilizers, some of which require only one application every six to nine months</p>
        <p>There are several ways to apply granular and water-soluble fertilizers, but there are a few general guidelines that one should follow when applying them. Avoid applying a fertilizer on windy <br>
            or rainy days. This can cause it to be misplaced and ineffective. When using a granular fertilizer, always be sure to knock the fertilizer off plant leaves to avoid burn. <br>
            Never apply a granular fertilizer when the soil is extremely dry, and water it in thoroughly after applying to prevent plant burn.</p>
        <h2>When to Fertilize</h2>
        <p>Knowing when to fertilize is as important as using the right fertilizer. If you don’t apply the fertilizer at a time when the plant can use it,<br>
            there’s no point in fertilizing. Most perennials, annuals, vegetables, and lawns will reward you handsomely if fed with a balanced granular fertil­izer in early<br>
            spring. Avoid fertilizing before the spring showers, however, or you will be throwing your money away, since the nutrients will simply leach out of the soil.<br>
            Annuals like to be fed an additional three to four times during the growing season with a high-phosphorus, water-soluble fertilizer, while lawns benefit from a second granular application in early fall.</p>
        <p>Roses have insatiable appetites. To keep them fat and happy, feed them with a soluble fertilizer every seven days during their blooming season. “Weekly, weakly” is the feeding mantra for all roses.<br>
            One final thought: Feed only well-established plants; fertilizing seeds or tiny seedlings will cause fertilizer burn.</p>
