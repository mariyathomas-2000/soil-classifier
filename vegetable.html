        <h2>Most Required Nutrients</h2>
        <p>1.Nitrogen(N)<br>
            2.Phosphorus(P)<br>
            3.Potassium(K)
        </p>
        <h2>Nutrient Sources</h2>
        <p>The nutrient content (fertilizer analysis) is required to be printed on every bag of commercially available <br>
            fertilizer. The first number indicates the percent of nitrogen (N), the second number is the percent of phosphate (P2O5)<br>
            a source of phosphorus, and the third number is the percent of potash (K2O) a source of potassium.<br>
            They are simply referred to as N-P-K. A 50 lb. bag of 5-10-5 contains 2½ lbs. of N, 5 lbs. of P2O5 and 2½ lbs. of K2O.</p>
        <p>
            The rest of the material is made up of other inert material, such as sand or clay granules to help spread the fertilizer.<br>
            
            When nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are all needed, use a complete fertilizer that contains all 3 nutrients.<br>
            For example: 10-10-10, 5-10-5, or 5-10-10. Use Table E to determine which complete fertilizer could be used based on your soil test results.<br>
            
            Recommendations for phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) nutrients will only be made if nutrients are low.<br>
            Additional P or K should not be added unless soil test levels are low.</p>
        <h3>Table A lists some common nitrogen fertilizers and <br>
            the amount needed to apply based on the fertilizer analysis.</h3>
        <img src="image/tableA.png" alt="table">
        <h3>Nitrogen(N)</h3>
        <p>When possible, apply about 1/3 of the nitrogen pre-plant, another 1/3 at transplanting possibly in the form of a starter solution <br>
            and the rest a few weeks after planting as a side-dress.
            For established <u>vegetable gardens, if nitrogen was not applied before planting,<br>
                apply half the recommended rate as a side dress immediately and then the other half after a couple weeks.</u><br>
                Apply the side dress fertilizer 2 to 4” from the growing plant to avoid contact with green<br>
                
plant tissue, lightly rake into the soil and then water it in to move fertilizer through soil to where roots are growing
        </P>
        <br>
        <h3>Table B lists recommended side-dress rates and timing.</h3>
        <img src="image/tableB.png" alt="tableB">
        <h3>Phosphorus (P)</h3>
        <p><u>Phosphorus is important in early root development and improves the quality of vegetables and fruits</u>.<br>
            Phosphorus does not move in the soil much. It is best to incorporate P into the soil before planting so the roots can access more<br>
            of this nutrient. A starter phosphorus solution is often applied when transplanting small plants in early spring when<br>
            soils are cold even when phosphorus levels are adequate</p>
        <img src="image/tableC.png" alt="tableC">
        <h3>Potassium (K)</h3>
        <p>Potassium increases water efficiency, improves stress tolerance and the quality of seeds and fruit<br>
            Wood ashes are not used as an amendment to improve soil physical properties. However, they do contain potassium <br>
            (3-7% K20) and can be used to raise soil pH in place of lime.<br>
            
Avoid applying both lime and wood ashes which can raise the soil pH beyond the optimum range of 6.0-7.0</p>
